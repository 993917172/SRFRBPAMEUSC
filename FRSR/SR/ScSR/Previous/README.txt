This folder contains the experiment images used in the paper "Image Super-resolution as Sparse Representation of Raw Image Patches", CVPR 2008.
Each foler corresponds to one figure in our paper.

The images are named as:

Low: low resolution image.

High: original high resolution image.

Nearest Neighbor: simple replicate interpolation.

Bicubic: bicubic interpolation.

Irani Backprojection: See
"Motion Analysis for image enhancement: resolution, occlusion and transparency", JVCIP, 1993.

Neighbor Embedding: see
"Super-resolution through neighbor embedding", CVPR, 2004.

Soft Edge Prior: See
"Soft Edge Smoothness prior for alpha channel super resolution", CVPR, 2007

Our: our method


Thank Shengyang Dai for providing some of their results.
